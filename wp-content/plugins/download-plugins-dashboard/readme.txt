Download installed plugins and themes ZIP files directly from your admin dashboard without using FTP.

== Description ==

**Download Plugins and Themes from Dashboard** plugin lets you download installed plugins and themes ZIP files directly from your admin dashboard without using FTP.

There are no required settings in plugin - after installation **Download ZIP** links will be automatically added to all:

* plugins - to your *Plugins > Installed Plugins* menu, and
* themes - to your *Appearance > Themes* menu.

Also there are **Download all** plugins and/or themes tools in "Settings > Download Plugins and Themes".

Additionally in "Settings > Download Plugins and Themes" you can set if you want to append version number to ZIP filename, and/or if you want main plugin's or theme's directory to be included in ZIP.

Advanced settings include selecting different ZIP libraries (ZipArchive or PclZip), and setting custom temporary directory on your server.

[Pro version](https://wpfactory.com/item/download-plugins-and-themes-from-dashboard/) has option to set **periodical** plugins and/or themes **downloads**.
